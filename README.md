## Bio
I am a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical Engineering at the University of Notre Dame, working with Prof. Thomas O’Sullivan. My research focuses on the design and development of compact, wearable frequency-domain near-infrared spectroscopy (FD-NIRS) systems. I specialize in analog/digital hardware design, embedded systems, PCB development, and optoelectronic integration for real-time tissue imaging. I’ve collaborated with cross-institutional teams including UC Irvine and industry partners on ASIC validation and brain imaging system development. I’m currently seeking full-time roles in hardware design, embedded systems, or medical device R&D.

## Projects
